00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:01.439
You all probably know that Mark

2
00:00:01.439 --> 00:00:03.200
Zuckerberg started Facebook from his

3
00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:05.520
Harvard dorm room in 2004. But did you

4
00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:07.919
know that Google began as a PhD research

5
00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:09.920
project at Stanford? Or what about the

6
00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:12.240
fact that Dropbox, Reddit, and Snapchat

7
00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:14.080
were all founded by students while they

8
00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:16.640
were in school? Over 60% of Gen Z say

9
00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:18.080
they want to start their own business

10
00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:20.320
instead of work a traditional job. And I

11
00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:22.240
think there is no better time to scratch

12
00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:24.080
this entrepreneurial itch than while

13
00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:26.320
you're a student. But that might sound

14
00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:28.160
weird to you. If you're a student, don't

15
00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:30.160
you have extracurriculars and exams to

16
00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:32.079
worry about? What business do you have

17
00:00:32.079 --> 00:00:34.160
starting a business? But you know what

18
00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:35.600
you'll have to worry about when you get

19
00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:38.320
even older? A mortgage and kids. As a

20
00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:40.320
student, you have room to take risk, and

21
00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:42.640
you have access to worldclass resources

22
00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:44.640
designed to help you out. We're going to

23
00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:46.399
talk about all that and much more in

24
00:00:46.399 --> 00:00:48.320
today's video. So, grab your notebook,

25
00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:50.079
throw in some Shark Tank, and let's dive

26
00:00:50.079 --> 00:00:52.239
into these six steps to start your first

27
00:00:52.239 --> 00:00:54.559
business as a student. Thanks to Claude

28
00:00:54.559 --> 00:00:56.719
for sponsoring this video. Step one,

29
00:00:56.719 --> 00:00:59.680
spot a problem you can solve. In 2011, a

30
00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:01.680
pair of students at Stanford University

31
00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:03.680
named Reggie and Evan noticed the

32
00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:05.438
problem with social media. They didn't

33
00:01:05.438 --> 00:01:07.200
want to share certain photos because

34
00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:09.600
they'd live online forever. So, Reggie

35
00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:11.840
pitched the idea of disappearing photos,

36
00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:13.920
a way to communicate more freely without

37
00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:16.000
the fear of a digital footprint. That

38
00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.080
idea became an app called Peekaboo,

39
00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:20.640
which eventually became Snapchat. And a

40
00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:22.720
mere two years later, Facebook famously

41
00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:26.560
offered to buy it for $3 billion, but

42
00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:28.159
they declined. The moral of the story

43
00:01:28.159 --> 00:01:30.000
here isn't to turn down billions of

44
00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:31.680
dollars because I think it's

45
00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:33.439
mind-blowing they had the strength to

46
00:01:33.439 --> 00:01:35.360
decline. Rather, the point is to pause

47
00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:37.360
and reflect for a moment on the small

48
00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:39.759
problems you face on a daily basis.

49
00:01:39.759 --> 00:01:41.520
Students often think they need a big

50
00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:43.680
idea or tons of investors to start a

51
00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:45.680
business. But the truth is, some of the

52
00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:47.759
most successful businesses, you know,

53
00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:50.720
started off as tiny, unsuspecting ideas.

54
00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:52.560
Snapchat was just disappearing photos at

55
00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:54.960
the start. Nothing revolutionary, but it

56
00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:57.280
targeted a legitimate problem, and

57
00:01:57.280 --> 00:01:59.040
that's what's most important. So, think

58
00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:00.560
about something that's inefficient or

59
00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:02.399
annoying, something that constantly gets

60
00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:04.159
on your nerves. For example, does your

61
00:02:04.159 --> 00:02:06.240
school have slow cafeteria lines? Do

62
00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:08.318
students feel really isolated? Are some

63
00:02:08.318 --> 00:02:10.560
campus events really lame? Reflecting is

64
00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:12.800
a great way to identify problems, but

65
00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:15.440
there are also two other ways. You can

66
00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:17.599
ask others such as friends and family,

67
00:02:17.599 --> 00:02:20.480
or you can also ask AI. This is where

68
00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:22.560
Claude is extremely useful. Let's use

69
00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:24.560
their latest model, Sonnet 4, to

70
00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:26.560
generate some ideas. And here's a prompt

71
00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:28.319
template you can use to get started. I'm

72
00:02:28.319 --> 00:02:30.319
a major student at school type. I want

73
00:02:30.319 --> 00:02:32.160
to start a business solving real student

74
00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:34.400
problems. Analyze my situation. And then

75
00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:35.920
you're going to describe your situation

76
00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:38.080
and generate 10 specific pain points

77
00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:40.080
students face. then suggest which could

78
00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:42.879
become profitable solutions under $200

79
00:02:42.879 --> 00:02:44.720
startup cost. So, here we go. Let me go

80
00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:46.400
ahead and fill it in. And here are some

81
00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:48.239
of the things it has suggested. Textbook

82
00:02:48.239 --> 00:02:49.840
sharing marketplace. That one's pretty

83
00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:51.360
interesting. Study group matching

84
00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:52.879
service, campus food delivery

85
00:02:52.879 --> 00:02:54.879
optimization, apartment/ roommate

86
00:02:54.879 --> 00:02:56.800
matching with compatibility scoring. And

87
00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:58.319
what's really cool is that Claude isn't

88
00:02:58.319 --> 00:03:00.080
just throwing out a bunch of ideas, it's

89
00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:01.760
also categorizing them in terms of

90
00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:03.760
profit potential. And then my absolute

91
00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:05.519
favorite part is that at the very end,

92
00:03:05.519 --> 00:03:07.200
instead of just saying choose whatever

93
00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:09.120
you want, it actually gives you a

94
00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:10.879
recommendation. And in this case, it's

95
00:03:10.879 --> 00:03:12.480
saying to start with the textbook

96
00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:14.640
marketplace or the study group matching.

97
00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:16.720
Step two, use what you already know.

98
00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:18.640
Everyone watching this has a toolkit.

99
00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:20.560
Not literally, well, maybe literally,

100
00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:22.319
but also figuratively. Now, every

101
00:03:22.319 --> 00:03:23.760
toolkit is different. They come with

102
00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:25.280
different tools. They come in different

103
00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:27.599
sizes. But here's the thing. Everyone

104
00:03:27.599 --> 00:03:29.920
has one. My toolkit contains coding,

105
00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:31.680
graphic design, and editing. Your

106
00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:33.599
toolkit might contain writing, painting,

107
00:03:33.599 --> 00:03:35.280
and speaking. No matter what yours

108
00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:37.680
contains, just know it's enough to get

109
00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:39.680
started. Your goal right now isn't to

110
00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:41.200
devise the best solution to your

111
00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:43.280
problem. I can tell you already that you

112
00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:45.280
won't, at least at the start. Your goal

113
00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:48.080
is to simply provide a solution that you

114
00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:50.159
yourself can build with whatever tools

115
00:03:50.159 --> 00:03:51.760
you have. For example, let's say you

116
00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:53.040
want to help students be more

117
00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:54.879
productive. If you know how to code, you

118
00:03:54.879 --> 00:03:56.640
might build a progress tracker app. If

119
00:03:56.640 --> 00:03:58.239
you know how to design, you might create

120
00:03:58.239 --> 00:04:00.000
a physical planner. If you know how to

121
00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:01.680
edit, you might upload productivity

122
00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:03.599
videos on social media. The biggest

123
00:04:03.599 --> 00:04:05.519
mistake students make is that they wait

124
00:04:05.519 --> 00:04:07.760
for the perfect toolkit, but it doesn't

125
00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:09.680
exist. So, grab a piece of paper and

126
00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:12.000
list out all your tools. And don't limit

127
00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.000
yourself to hard skills like coding or

128
00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:15.920
writing. Soft skills such as speaking

129
00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:17.440
also count. Now, with this piece of

130
00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:19.279
paper in hand, think about how you can

131
00:04:19.279 --> 00:04:21.279
fuse two or more of these skills to

132
00:04:21.279 --> 00:04:22.960
approach your problem. Now, that might

133
00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:24.880
be a tough task, and luckily, that's

134
00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:27.040
where Claude comes in. Again, let's use

135
00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:28.720
the following prompt template. I have

136
00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:30.560
skills in two to three specific areas

137
00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:32.479
and want to offer services to college

138
00:04:32.479 --> 00:04:34.720
students. Give me five tailored business

139
00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:36.720
ideas with service packages and

140
00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:38.880
realistic pricing that students would

141
00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:40.560
actually pay for. Okay, so let's go

142
00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:41.919
ahead and fill this out. Let's say we

143
00:04:41.919 --> 00:04:43.680
have skills in social media marketing,

144
00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:45.520
app development, and music. And let's

145
00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:46.960
say we want to help students play

146
00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:48.880
instruments. And very quickly, Claude

147
00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:50.880
gives us some specific business ideas.

148
00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:52.880
Interactive music learning app, virtual

149
00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:55.040
music academy platform, AI powered

150
00:04:55.040 --> 00:04:56.880
practice companion app, and the list

151
00:04:56.880 --> 00:04:59.120
goes on. And if you want even deeper and

152
00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:00.960
more nuanced business ideas, you can

153
00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:02.960
turn on research mode so Claude really

154
00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:04.880
takes his time to think. Step three,

155
00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:07.440
build a tiny testable offer. Now that

156
00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:09.440
you have a list of business ideas, the

157
00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:11.520
worst thing you can do is to go out and

158
00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:13.600
actually build the business. Let me

159
00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:15.360
explain. If you have an idea, you want

160
00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:17.520
to start with something called an MVP or

161
00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:20.320
the minimum viable product. In essence,

162
00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:22.080
it's the simplest working version of

163
00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:24.240
your product or service. And sometimes

164
00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:26.560
it doesn't even need to work. A famous

165
00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:28.560
example is Dropbox. And for those who

166
00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:30.880
don't know, Dropbox is a popular cloud

167
00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:32.960
storage service that lets you store and

168
00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:36.000
share files, and it's worth billions of

169
00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:38.560
dollars. In 2007, the founder, Drew

170
00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:40.800
Houston, who went to MIT, by the way,

171
00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:42.960
recorded a 3minute video showing what

172
00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:45.759
Dropbox would do. He showcased the clean

173
00:05:45.759 --> 00:05:47.520
UI, the fluid drag and drop

174
00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:50.000
functionality, and the seamless syncing.

175
00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:52.400
But here's the thing, none of it was

176
00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:54.400
real. It was a fake demo that helped him

177
00:05:54.400 --> 00:05:56.320
garner a bunch of interest and prove

178
00:05:56.320 --> 00:05:58.080
that his product was worth building. The

179
00:05:58.080 --> 00:05:59.120
worst thing you can do as an

180
00:05:59.120 --> 00:06:01.199
entrepreneur is spend months or even

181
00:06:01.199 --> 00:06:03.360
years building a business without any

182
00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:05.759
feedback. An MVP lets you quickly go to

183
00:06:05.759 --> 00:06:08.160
market and see if your idea is worth it.

184
00:06:08.160 --> 00:06:09.680
Now, does this mean that you should also

185
00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:12.240
create a fake demo video? Of course not.

186
00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:14.800
Ideally, your MVP will be a simple

187
00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:16.639
functioning version of your product

188
00:06:16.639 --> 00:06:18.319
coupled with a landing page to bring

189
00:06:18.319 --> 00:06:20.479
users in. And luckily, we can use Claude

190
00:06:20.479 --> 00:06:23.120
to build a simple prototype in minutes.

191
00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:24.720
Say we want to build a study group

192
00:06:24.720 --> 00:06:26.479
finder for college students. We could

193
00:06:26.479 --> 00:06:28.240
then ask Claude the following. Create a

194
00:06:28.240 --> 00:06:29.759
study group finder where students can

195
00:06:29.759 --> 00:06:31.440
post what subject they're studying, when

196
00:06:31.440 --> 00:06:33.199
they're available, and join existing

197
00:06:33.199 --> 00:06:35.360
groups. Include a simple form and group

198
00:06:35.360 --> 00:06:37.520
listings. Very quickly, Claude generates

199
00:06:37.520 --> 00:06:39.440
a working prototype with all the core

200
00:06:39.440 --> 00:06:41.120
functionality. Now, you can immediately

201
00:06:41.120 --> 00:06:43.120
test it, share it with classmates, and

202
00:06:43.120 --> 00:06:45.120
see if students actually want this thing

203
00:06:45.120 --> 00:06:47.440
without spending weeks coding. Now, this

204
00:06:47.440 --> 00:06:49.280
looks fantastic, but if we want to build

205
00:06:49.280 --> 00:06:51.440
a robust application, we can move to

206
00:06:51.440 --> 00:06:53.440
something called Claude Code. This is an

207
00:06:53.440 --> 00:06:56.000
AI tool that can build real software for

208
00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:57.919
you. Now, I am stoked to show you how

209
00:06:57.919 --> 00:06:59.840
this works. We'll open up Claude Code

210
00:06:59.840 --> 00:07:01.440
here and type in what we're looking to

211
00:07:01.440 --> 00:07:02.960
create. And here's the template we're

212
00:07:02.960 --> 00:07:04.479
going to use. I'm creating a weekly

213
00:07:04.479 --> 00:07:06.160
planner for target customer who

214
00:07:06.160 --> 00:07:08.000
struggles with problem. Write compelling

215
00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:10.000
landing page copy, create three service

216
00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:12.160
tiers with pricing, and provide basic

217
00:07:12.160 --> 00:07:14.720
HTML and CSS for a professional website.

218
00:07:14.720 --> 00:07:16.240
So now once we go ahead and fill this

219
00:07:16.240 --> 00:07:18.000
in, Claude Code will break down the

220
00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:20.080
project for us and start implementing it

221
00:07:20.080 --> 00:07:21.840
on our behalf. And it's actually

222
00:07:21.840 --> 00:07:23.680
mind-boggling how good this program

223
00:07:23.680 --> 00:07:25.120
looks right away. You all should have

224
00:07:25.120 --> 00:07:27.120
fun with this because this is truly a

225
00:07:27.120 --> 00:07:29.440
new era of software development. You can

226
00:07:29.440 --> 00:07:31.039
build whatever you want, even if you

227
00:07:31.039 --> 00:07:33.039
don't know how to code. Step four, get

228
00:07:33.039 --> 00:07:35.440
your first 10 users. Now that you've

229
00:07:35.440 --> 00:07:37.599
built your MVP, it's time to go out into

230
00:07:37.599 --> 00:07:39.840
the world and acquire your first actual

231
00:07:39.840 --> 00:07:41.680
users. It doesn't matter how you get

232
00:07:41.680 --> 00:07:43.759
them. The goal is just to get them. And

233
00:07:43.759 --> 00:07:45.759
this will probably be the scrappiest,

234
00:07:45.759 --> 00:07:47.680
most inefficient marketing you'll ever

235
00:07:47.680 --> 00:07:49.840
do. But right now, the goal isn't to

236
00:07:49.840 --> 00:07:52.000
scale. It's just to get started.

237
00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:54.000
Approach friends, approach enemies,

238
00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:56.319
approach family, approach strangers.

239
00:07:56.319 --> 00:07:58.000
Pitch your product and see how they

240
00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:00.000
react. And each time, tweak it a little

241
00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:01.520
bit. Over time, you'll land on the

242
00:08:01.520 --> 00:08:03.680
messaging that resonates best. Here's a

243
00:08:03.680 --> 00:08:06.240
very simple formula. I created a product

244
00:08:06.240 --> 00:08:08.240
that helps target customer solve

245
00:08:08.240 --> 00:08:10.400
problem. Would you like to try? Clean

246
00:08:10.400 --> 00:08:12.639
and simple. No buzzwords. Now, sure, you

247
00:08:12.639 --> 00:08:14.560
can say crazy stuff like cloudnative

248
00:08:14.560 --> 00:08:16.400
infrastructure and make people think you

249
00:08:16.400 --> 00:08:18.000
sound smart, but most of the time,

250
00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:20.000
they'll just have no idea what you mean.

251
00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:21.360
And more likely than not, they'll just

252
00:08:21.360 --> 00:08:22.639
think you're full of it. Now, as you

253
00:08:22.639 --> 00:08:24.160
onboard users to your product or

254
00:08:24.160 --> 00:08:26.319
service, the most important thing is to

255
00:08:26.319 --> 00:08:28.800
hound them for feedback. Do anything you

256
00:08:28.800 --> 00:08:31.120
can to deeply understand why people like

257
00:08:31.120 --> 00:08:33.519
or dislike your product. And I mean

258
00:08:33.519 --> 00:08:35.760
anything. Brian Chesy, the co-founder of

259
00:08:35.760 --> 00:08:38.640
Airbnb, personally emailed every single

260
00:08:38.640 --> 00:08:40.799
host in New York City in the early days

261
00:08:40.799 --> 00:08:42.958
to understand what was stalling growth.

262
00:08:42.958 --> 00:08:45.200
He then flew to New York, met users in

263
00:08:45.200 --> 00:08:47.200
their apartments, and asked them about

264
00:08:47.200 --> 00:08:49.279
the platform. And only then did he

265
00:08:49.279 --> 00:08:51.120
discover that most listings had

266
00:08:51.120 --> 00:08:54.000
lowquality photos. Airbnb didn't succeed

267
00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:55.360
because they had groundbreaking

268
00:08:55.360 --> 00:08:57.440
technology. Sure, the technology helped,

269
00:08:57.440 --> 00:08:59.200
but it's because the founders had the

270
00:08:59.200 --> 00:09:01.519
grit to hop on a plane and literally

271
00:09:01.519 --> 00:09:03.519
knock on doors to see where things went

272
00:09:03.519 --> 00:09:05.680
wrong. Now, feedback is great, but it's

273
00:09:05.680 --> 00:09:07.360
even more important to identify

274
00:09:07.360 --> 00:09:09.360
patterns. And this is where Claude is

275
00:09:09.360 --> 00:09:10.880
extremely helpful. Here's a prompt

276
00:09:10.880 --> 00:09:12.480
template. Here's my feedback from my

277
00:09:12.480 --> 00:09:14.000
first five customers. Then you want to

278
00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:15.360
paste in your feedback. And then you

279
00:09:15.360 --> 00:09:17.440
want to say, "Identify key patterns,

280
00:09:17.440 --> 00:09:19.680
prioritize which issues to fix first,

281
00:09:19.680 --> 00:09:21.839
and suggest three specific improvements

282
00:09:21.839 --> 00:09:23.760
that would boost customer satisfaction

283
00:09:23.760 --> 00:09:25.519
and referrals." So, let's go ahead and

284
00:09:25.519 --> 00:09:27.360
provide some feedback for a hypothetical

285
00:09:27.360 --> 00:09:29.519
plant care app. And very quickly, Claude

286
00:09:29.519 --> 00:09:31.360
identifies two key patterns. Plant care

287
00:09:31.360 --> 00:09:33.360
guidance is insufficient and product

288
00:09:33.360 --> 00:09:35.440
matching needs improvement. And then

289
00:09:35.440 --> 00:09:37.519
based on these key patterns, Claude then

290
00:09:37.519 --> 00:09:39.519
gives us three specific improvements. It

291
00:09:39.519 --> 00:09:41.200
tells us to create personalized care

292
00:09:41.200 --> 00:09:44.080
cards, to build a simple SMS/ care

293
00:09:44.080 --> 00:09:46.160
reminder system, and to redesign our

294
00:09:46.160 --> 00:09:48.399
plan quiz with situational questions.

295
00:09:48.399 --> 00:09:50.160
Notice how these are very specific

296
00:09:50.160 --> 00:09:52.160
suggestions. And this is exactly what

297
00:09:52.160 --> 00:09:53.680
we're looking for. And with that, let's

298
00:09:53.680 --> 00:09:55.600
move on to step five. Promote where your

299
00:09:55.600 --> 00:09:57.680
audience already is. Once you've gotten

300
00:09:57.680 --> 00:09:59.920
that early feedback, now it's time to

301
00:09:59.920 --> 00:10:02.000
slowly scale your marketing efforts. But

302
00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:03.519
that doesn't mean you have to spend

303
00:10:03.519 --> 00:10:05.600
money. There are two types of marketing,

304
00:10:05.600 --> 00:10:07.839
organic and paid. Organic marketing

305
00:10:07.839 --> 00:10:09.600
consists of social media, and word of

306
00:10:09.600 --> 00:10:11.760
mouth. Paid marketing consists of ads,

307
00:10:11.760 --> 00:10:13.760
billboards, and even commercials. And

308
00:10:13.760 --> 00:10:15.120
I'm not suggesting you run a commercial

309
00:10:15.120 --> 00:10:16.880
yet. We live in an era where you could

310
00:10:16.880 --> 00:10:18.959
pick up your phone, record a short clip

311
00:10:18.959 --> 00:10:21.040
about your business, and go viral

312
00:10:21.040 --> 00:10:22.959
overnight. Pull up an episode of Shark

313
00:10:22.959 --> 00:10:24.959
Tank and I guarantee you that a majority

314
00:10:24.959 --> 00:10:26.880
of businesses have experienced something

315
00:10:26.880 --> 00:10:28.399
like this. Now, instead of telling you

316
00:10:28.399 --> 00:10:30.480
the story of a random founder, I'll tell

317
00:10:30.480 --> 00:10:33.440
you the story about myself. In 2020, I

318
00:10:33.440 --> 00:10:35.519
uploaded a short form video promoting my

319
00:10:35.519 --> 00:10:37.680
college consulting business, Next Admin.

320
00:10:37.680 --> 00:10:38.880
Here, let me go ahead and play it for

321
00:10:38.880 --> 00:10:40.480
you right now. So, you're in high school

322
00:10:40.480 --> 00:10:41.839
and you decided you want to go to

323
00:10:41.839 --> 00:10:43.519
college, but you're not sure where to

324
00:10:43.519 --> 00:10:45.519
start. Almost overnight, we went from

325
00:10:45.519 --> 00:10:48.720
10K to 50K followers and drew in a bunch

326
00:10:48.720 --> 00:10:50.959
of customers. And I didn't have to pay

327
00:10:50.959 --> 00:10:53.360
for a single ad. I simply let the

328
00:10:53.360 --> 00:10:55.519
algorithm find the right people. And if

329
00:10:55.519 --> 00:10:57.200
you've correctly followed everything in

330
00:10:57.200 --> 00:10:59.040
this video thus far, then I can assure

331
00:10:59.040 --> 00:11:01.040
you that the algorithm will find people

332
00:11:01.040 --> 00:11:02.800
for your business. Because by this

333
00:11:02.800 --> 00:11:04.560
point, you've identified a legitimate

334
00:11:04.560 --> 00:11:06.800
problem, built an MVP, received

335
00:11:06.800 --> 00:11:09.440
feedback, and have started iterating.

336
00:11:09.440 --> 00:11:10.720
Now, if you're struggling to think of

337
00:11:10.720 --> 00:11:12.560
video ideas, you know what we can do?

338
00:11:12.560 --> 00:11:14.399
We're going to resort to Claude. And

339
00:11:14.399 --> 00:11:16.160
here's a helpful prompt template. I'm

340
00:11:16.160 --> 00:11:17.680
launching business description for

341
00:11:17.680 --> 00:11:19.920
audience on platforms. Create five

342
00:11:19.920 --> 00:11:22.320
Instagram captions, three Tik Tok hooks,

343
00:11:22.320 --> 00:11:24.800
and 10 personalized DM templates that

344
00:11:24.800 --> 00:11:26.720
sound authentic to a college student

345
00:11:26.720 --> 00:11:28.640
with clear calls to action. And what

346
00:11:28.640 --> 00:11:30.880
impresses me most about this output is

347
00:11:30.880 --> 00:11:33.200
just how detailed it is. Notice how the

348
00:11:33.200 --> 00:11:35.120
captions have emojis and hashtags and

349
00:11:35.120 --> 00:11:36.720
they're fun to read. And not only do we

350
00:11:36.720 --> 00:11:38.640
have the hooks like we asked for, but we

351
00:11:38.640 --> 00:11:40.480
also have ideas for each individual

352
00:11:40.480 --> 00:11:42.720
video. Claude has gone all out here to

353
00:11:42.720 --> 00:11:44.160
make sure that the messaging that we're

354
00:11:44.160 --> 00:11:46.399
using sounds authentic to us and our

355
00:11:46.399 --> 00:11:48.160
product. And I do want to say we're not

356
00:11:48.160 --> 00:11:49.519
going to just be copying and pasting

357
00:11:49.519 --> 00:11:51.040
this directly. You should, of course,

358
00:11:51.040 --> 00:11:52.959
add your own personal twist and modify

359
00:11:52.959 --> 00:11:54.959
the messages as you see fit. Ultimately,

360
00:11:54.959 --> 00:11:56.800
we're not using AI to sell our product

361
00:11:56.800 --> 00:11:58.959
or to write entire pitches. We're just

362
00:11:58.959 --> 00:12:00.720
using it to help us get started. And

363
00:12:00.720 --> 00:12:02.560
now, as you start posting this content,

364
00:12:02.560 --> 00:12:04.160
it's important to capture something

365
00:12:04.160 --> 00:12:06.399
called leads. A lead is a phone number

366
00:12:06.399 --> 00:12:08.320
or an email address from someone who's

367
00:12:08.320 --> 00:12:10.240
expressed interest. This way, you can

368
00:12:10.240 --> 00:12:11.839
continue to reach out and pitch your

369
00:12:11.839 --> 00:12:14.880
product. Okay. Step six, reinvest and

370
00:12:14.880 --> 00:12:16.480
level up. You should now have something

371
00:12:16.480 --> 00:12:18.480
called a product flywheel. You market

372
00:12:18.480 --> 00:12:20.399
your product to get new users. Those

373
00:12:20.399 --> 00:12:22.480
users then give you feedback, and then

374
00:12:22.480 --> 00:12:24.320
you improve the product, which you then

375
00:12:24.320 --> 00:12:26.639
market again to get new users. Over

376
00:12:26.639 --> 00:12:28.399
time, your product only gets better and

377
00:12:28.399 --> 00:12:30.880
better as your customer base also grows.

378
00:12:30.880 --> 00:12:33.120
Once you have the flywheel moving, now

379
00:12:33.120 --> 00:12:34.880
you can worry about all the little

380
00:12:34.880 --> 00:12:37.279
details, your aesthetic, your logo, all

381
00:12:37.279 --> 00:12:39.040
the bells and whistles of your product.

382
00:12:39.040 --> 00:12:40.880
Most founders obsess over these elements

383
00:12:40.880 --> 00:12:42.639
at the start, even before they've

384
00:12:42.639 --> 00:12:44.959
validated their ideas. Yes, spend some

385
00:12:44.959 --> 00:12:46.880
time on your logo and brand in the early

386
00:12:46.880 --> 00:12:49.200
days, but don't hire some fancy designer

387
00:12:49.200 --> 00:12:51.279
or waste your own time trying to perfect

388
00:12:51.279 --> 00:12:53.040
it. Just take a look at how some of the

389
00:12:53.040 --> 00:12:54.800
most popular companies started off. This

390
00:12:54.800 --> 00:12:57.040
right here is Duolingo's evolution. This

391
00:12:57.040 --> 00:12:59.120
is Facebook's. And this right here is

392
00:12:59.120 --> 00:13:01.519
Airbnbs. Your goal right now isn't to

393
00:13:01.519 --> 00:13:03.680
get it perfect. Your goal is to just

394
00:13:03.680 --> 00:13:06.240
make it exist. You can and will refine

395
00:13:06.240 --> 00:13:07.920
everything over time. Now might be a

396
00:13:07.920 --> 00:13:09.600
good time to mention all the other stuff

397
00:13:09.600 --> 00:13:11.839
I've also left out. starting an LLC,

398
00:13:11.839 --> 00:13:14.320
filing taxes, opening up a business bank

399
00:13:14.320 --> 00:13:16.000
account. When most people think about

400
00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:17.680
starting a business, their mind

401
00:13:17.680 --> 00:13:20.240
immediately goes to opening up an LLC.

402
00:13:20.240 --> 00:13:22.160
Yes, it's an important step, but you

403
00:13:22.160 --> 00:13:24.000
don't need to figure it out right away.

404
00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:25.680
And in some cases, you might not even

405
00:13:25.680 --> 00:13:27.279
need it. Plus, it's important to note

406
00:13:27.279 --> 00:13:29.120
that if you're a student, your college

407
00:13:29.120 --> 00:13:30.880
might have resources to help you with

408
00:13:30.880 --> 00:13:32.800
all the paperwork and logistics. For

409
00:13:32.800 --> 00:13:34.880
example, MIT had a law clinic that

410
00:13:34.880 --> 00:13:36.880
helped me register my company, Next

411
00:13:36.880 --> 00:13:39.200
Admit. MIT also had an entrepreneurship

412
00:13:39.200 --> 00:13:40.880
center which offered a ton more

413
00:13:40.880 --> 00:13:43.200
resources such as pitch competitions,

414
00:13:43.200 --> 00:13:45.519
maker spaces, and innovation grants. And

415
00:13:45.519 --> 00:13:47.279
if your college has these, you can use

416
00:13:47.279 --> 00:13:49.200
claw to make the most of them. Here's a

417
00:13:49.200 --> 00:13:50.720
prompt template you can use. I'm

418
00:13:50.720 --> 00:13:52.880
applying for grant/competition with my

419
00:13:52.880 --> 00:13:54.480
business. And then you want to put in a

420
00:13:54.480 --> 00:13:56.320
description, help me create a document

421
00:13:56.320 --> 00:13:58.000
type that positions my student

422
00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:00.240
perspective as an advantage and includes

423
00:14:00.240 --> 00:14:02.320
realistic projections for specific

424
00:14:02.320 --> 00:14:04.560
requirements. Notice how Claude outputs

425
00:14:04.560 --> 00:14:06.399
a detailed executive summary of this

426
00:14:06.399 --> 00:14:08.240
hypothetical business. Now, of course,

427
00:14:08.240 --> 00:14:09.760
when you use this prompt, you should

428
00:14:09.760 --> 00:14:11.440
provide a bunch of data so Claude's

429
00:14:11.440 --> 00:14:13.279
output is accurate. But the point here

430
00:14:13.279 --> 00:14:15.040
is just to give you a sense of what this

431
00:14:15.040 --> 00:14:16.800
AI can do. And plus, you should never

432
00:14:16.800 --> 00:14:18.800
just blindly use whatever it outputs.

433
00:14:18.800 --> 00:14:20.399
You should always refine it and make

434
00:14:20.399 --> 00:14:22.240
sure it aligns with what you're actually

435
00:14:22.240 --> 00:14:23.920
doing. And that applies to all the

436
00:14:23.920 --> 00:14:25.440
prompts we've used thus far. All right.

437
00:14:25.440 --> 00:14:26.959
And with that, you should be on your way

438
00:14:26.959 --> 00:14:28.880
to starting your first business. Whether

439
00:14:28.880 --> 00:14:31.040
it's a lemonade stand or the next AI

440
00:14:31.040 --> 00:14:33.279
unicorn, the principle in this videos

441
00:14:33.279 --> 00:14:35.040
will always hold true. Building a

442
00:14:35.040 --> 00:14:37.440
business is not a linear process. It's a

443
00:14:37.440 --> 00:14:39.360
loop, one that you'll go through again

444
00:14:39.360 --> 00:14:41.760
and again and again. In fact, maybe you

445
00:14:41.760 --> 00:14:43.519
should loop this video just so you can

446
00:14:43.519 --> 00:14:45.760
internalize all the principles. If you

447
00:14:45.760 --> 00:14:47.680
want a part two or have any questions,

448
00:14:47.680 --> 00:14:49.680
let me know in the comments. Or maybe

449
00:14:49.680 --> 00:14:51.920
you can ask Claude. Sonnet 4 is an

450
00:14:51.920 --> 00:14:53.760
incredibly powerful model and can

451
00:14:53.760 --> 00:14:56.320
essentially serve as your AI co-founder.

452
00:14:56.320 --> 00:14:57.920
Try it out. Let me know what you think

453
00:14:57.920 --> 00:15:02.240
and I'll see you again next week.
